#To do something with each element of a list,run for loop
#To run a loop based on a condition run a while loop
#To stop a loop immediately based on a condition, use the break keyboard
#To skip iteration based on a condition, use the continue keyboard

*for loop vs while loop*

The while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. It relies on the evaluation of a condition to determine whether
 to continue iterating or exit the loop. The loop will keep running as long as the condition is true.

The for loop, on the other hand, is specifically designed for iterating over a known sequence or collection of elements. It iterates through the elements
 in the sequence one by one until all elements have been processed. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the length of the sequence.

Here's a summary:

*While Loop*:

/Executes as long as a given condition is true.
/Condition is evaluated before each iteration.
/Useful when the number of iterations is uncertain or depends on dynamic conditions.
/Requires manual control of loop variables and condition updates.
*For Loop*:

/Executes a fixed number of times based on the length of a sequence.
/Automatically iterates over the elements in a sequence.
/Suitable for iterating over known collections or sequences.
/Simplifies iteration and eliminates the need for manual loop control.
/In essence, the while loop gives you more flexibility in controlling the loop based on dynamic conditions, whereas the for loop provides a convenient way to
 iterate over a known sequence without the need for explicit loop control variables.

Both loops have their own use cases and can be powerful tools in programming. Choosing the appropriate loop depends on the specific requirements and
 nature of the problem you're trying to solve.

#Moral of the story : Use a for loop to loop through a list.
                      Use a while loop to loop based on a condition.
